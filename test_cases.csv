Issue Type,Summary,Description,Priority,Test Steps,Expected Result,Pass/Fail Condition
Test Case,AG-01: Successful Data Extraction and Schema Validation,Verify that the agent correctly extracts a complete patient record and validates it against the schema.,High,"1. Trigger the agent to fetch patient_id = P12345. 
2. Capture the extracted JSON. 
3. Validate JSON against schema. 
4. Compare each field/value with the source system.",Data must match schema and values must match the source. No missing or incorrect fields.,PASS if schema validation success + all field values match; FAIL otherwise.
Test Case,AG-02: Handling Missing Required Fields,Confirm that the agent detects missing mandatory fields and prevents invalid data from entering the pipeline.,High,"1. Trigger extraction on a record missing patient_id and dob. 
2. Review logs and validation output. 
3. Check if record is quarantined or flagged. 
4. Verify alert/notification is generated.",Record is rejected and logged. Data must not proceed.,PASS if missing fields are detected and user is notified; FAIL if system accepts invalid record.
Test Case,AG-03: Detect Incorrect Data Types and Formats,"Ensure that the agent identifies invalid formats (e.g., wrong date format) and either normalizes or rejects them.",Medium-High,"1. Extract record with invalid date formats. 
2. Validate data against schema. 
3. Observe normalization or error handling.",Agent normalizes formats OR rejects the record with clear validation errors.,PASS if either normalization occurs correctly by agent or identification of irregular format is detected; FAIL if invalid formats validation is successful
Test Case,AG-04: Connectivity Failure Handling,"Validate the agents retry, recovery, and deduplication behavior under network interruptions.",Medium,"1. Start extraction. 
2. Simulate network drop mid-transfer. 
3. Restore network. 
4. Observe retry and deduplication behavior.","Agent retries automatically, completes extraction correctly, no duplicates created.",PASS if retry/backoff works and final correct record ingested once; FAIL if data lost or duplicated.
Test Case,AG-05: Invalid Credentials Handling,Ensure the agent handles authentication failures securely without exposing sensitive information.,High,"1. Configure agent with invalid credentials/expired API token. 
2. Attempt extraction. 
3. Observe logs and alerts.",Access denied; agent logs security event and stops processing without exposing sensitive data.,PASS if access denied handled securely with proper logging; FAIL if agent attempts to bypass
Test Case,MI-01: Valid Input - Correct Model Output,Verify that the model returns the correct classification with high confidence for clean input.,High,"1. Submit structured input (age, symptoms, vitals). 
2. Capture class label and confidence. 
3. Compare with baseline.",Model returns expected classification with high confidence.,PASS if class_label and confidence within acceptable threshold; FAIL if mismatch or low confidence.
Test Case,MI-02: Malformed/Adversarial Input Handling,"Evaluate model behavior when inputs contain malformed text, long strings, or adversarial content.",High,"1. Submit malformed input (special chars, long strings). 
2. Observe model response.
3. Check for failures/crashes.",Model safely rejects or returns fallback response. No crashes or unsafe outputs.,"PASS if model handles gracefully (validation error / safe fallback) and logs the event; FAIL if it crashes, hangs, or returns an unsafe/hallucinated output."
Test Case,MI-03: Incomplete/Ambiguous Input Behavior,Verify that the model does not give overconfident predictions for unclear or incomplete data.,High,"1. Submit input missing key fields or with ambiguous symptoms. 
2. Capture output of the model.
3. Check for uncertainty or human-review suggestion.",Model outputs low confidence and avoids overconfident predictions. Suggests more info or review.,PASS if uncertainty handled correctly (low confidence + suggestion for human intervention); FAIL if overconfident prediction occurs.
Test Case,MI-04: Fairness and Bias Evaluation,Check for demographic bias by testing identical clinical data with different demographic attributes.,Medium-High,"1. Submit test records with identical core data but varied values like gender. 
2. Compare outputs.",Predictions remain consistent across demographics unless clinically justified. No unexplained bias.,PASS if disparities are within acceptable thresholds and documented; FAIL if significant unexplained bias exists.
Test Case,MI-05: Model Load & Performance Test,Validate that the model performs within SLA under load and degrades gracefully when overloaded.,Medium,"1. Run load test with increasing concurrent requests. 
2. Monitor response times/errors. 
3. Observe behavior under spikes.","Model stays within threshhold time under normal load. Under high load, responds gracefully without crashing.",PASS if latency & error rates within threshhold and graceful degradation observed; FAIL if high error rates or timeouts lead to silent downstream failures.
